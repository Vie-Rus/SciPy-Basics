# SciPy-Basics
 SciPy basic Tutorial
    To use SciPy you must numpy as SciPy builds off of it so...
    Install on computer's terminal
        $ pip install numpy
        $ pip install scipy

    + Vectoriztion
        - Vectoriztion: converts a normal function into a vectorized function

    + Statics
        - Cumulative Distribution, Percentage Point, Random Variant Sequence, Binomial Distribution

    + SpecialFunction
        Exponents, Sin in Degree Format, Cos indegree format
        - Provides exponential and trigonometric function
        - Calculate Gaussian Curve - ERF: erf()
        - Calcuate Gamma - Gamma: gamma()
        - Calcuate log of Gamma - Gammaln: gammaln()
        - Calcuate elliptic function - Eppilj: eppilj()
        - Repreents Nth order for the Bessel function - jn

    +SignalProcessing
        - This involves: Generation, Analyzing, modifying various signals, designing, filtering, interpolation 1D(not the band) and 2D
        - Resampling, Detrending, Ordered Filtering

    + Optimization
        - Various optimization algorithms: uncontrained and constrained multivariate, minimization scalar functions, global optimization, least-square minization and curve-fitting functions
        - Minimizers of scalar univariate functions and finder of roots, algorithms to solve multivariate equation systems

    + LinearAlgebra
        - Linear Equations, Inverse of a matrix, singular Value Decomposition (svd), Lower and Upper triangular matrices, Finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, Polynominals and Polynominals where x has a value/ with the product with itself/with integration/with differentiation

    + Integration
        - Signal Integration, Double Intergation

    + ConstantUnit
        - You can use Metric, Binary , Mass, Angle, Time, Length, Pressure, Area, Volume, Speed, Temperature, Energy, Power, and Force prefixes
        - To see all constants use dir
